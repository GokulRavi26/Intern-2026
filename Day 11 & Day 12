1️. Example Project Setup
Example repository:

Repo name: smart-factory
Main code branch: main
Daily report branch: daily-report
Machines used:
Desktop-1 (Work system)
Desktop-2 (Testing system)

2️. Cloning Repository (Desktop-1)
Example:
You cloned the GitHub repo smart-factory into:
Desktop-1/
 └── smart-factory/

In VS Code:
Opened Source Control
Clicked Clone Repository
Selected local folder

✔ Git Graph shows:
One branch: main
One commit: Initial commit

3️. Initial Commit (Existing Project Files)
Example files added:
src/
 ├── App.jsx
 ├── FactoryScene.jsx
 └── MachineModel.glb
README.md

What you did:
Copied files into cloned folder
VS Code detected changes
Staged all files
Commit message:
"Initial smart factory project setup"
Clicked Push / Sync

✔ Git Graph now shows:
One commit on main
Label: main, origin/main

4. Creating a New Branch (Daily Report)
Example branch:
daily-report

Using Git Graph:
Right-click on initial commit
Select Create new branch
Enter branch name: daily-report
Checkout the branch

✔ Git Graph shows:
A new line branching from initial commit
You are now on daily-report

5️.  Adding Daily Report Files (Example)
Example file added:
reports/
 └── day01_report.txt

File content:
Day 01:
- Set up Git repository
- Learned Git Graph

What you did:
Created the file
Staged the file in Source Control
Commit message:
"Added Day 01 daily report"
Clicked Push

✔ Result:
File exists only in daily-report
main branch is unchanged

6️. Git Graph View (What You See)
o───o  daily-report
 \
  o     main


Meaning:
Same base commit
Separate work
Safe isolation of reports

7️. Cloning Same Repo on Desktop-2
Example:
On Desktop-2 you cloned:
Desktop-2/
 └── smart-factory/

✔ Git Graph shows:
main
daily-report
Same commit history

8️. Fetching Updates Before Editing (Desktop-2)
Situation:

Desktop-1 already pushed:
day01_report.txt
What you did on Desktop-2:
Opened VS Code
Clicked Fetch / Sync
✔ Git Graph updated
✔ Desktop-2 now has latest reports
🔑 Rule: Always fetch before editing

9️.  Editing & Committing from Desktop-2 (Example)
Example new file:
reports/
 └── day02_report.txt
Content:
Day 02:
- Learned cherry-pick
- Learned stash

Steps:
Created the file
Staged changes
Commit message:
"Added Day 02 daily report"
Clicked Sync

✔ Git Graph:

Pushed to GitHub

10.  Updating Desktop-1

Before editing on Desktop-1:
Clicked Sync / Fetch
✔ Desktop-1 received:
day02_report.txt

✔ Both desktops are now in sync

11. Cherry-Pick Example (Using Git Graph)

You want this file in main

What you did:
Open Git Graph
Right-click commit "Added Git best practices"
Select Cherry-pick commit
Choose target branch: main

✔ Result:
That file appears in main
Other report files remain excluded

12.  Stash Example (UI Only)
