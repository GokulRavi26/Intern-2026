Today, I learned the basics of APIs and how different HTTP methods are used for communication between a client and a server. 
I understood that GET is used to retrieve data from the server, POST is used to send new data, PUT is used to update existing data, and DELETE is used to remove data from the server. 
I also learned about networking concepts such as client–server architecture, request and response flow, and how data is transferred over the network using HTTP. 
This helped me understand how Unity applications communicate with backend services to fetch and update real-time data.

🔹 1. GET Method
Purpose: Fetch data from the server
Used to read or retrieve information
Does not change data on the server
Example: Get machine status or temperature

🔹 2. POST Method
Purpose: Send new data to the server
Used to create new records
Data is sent in the request body
Server stores the data

🔹 3. PUT Method
Purpose: Update existing data
Used to modify or update existing records
Replaces old data with new data

🔹 4. DELETE Method
Purpose: Remove data from the server
Used to delete records
Permanently removes data

🌐 Networking Basics
Networking is the process of exchanging data between devices over a network (LAN or Internet).
🔹 Client–Server Architecture
Client: Unity application
Server: API / backend system

Flow:
1.Unity (Client) → Request → Server
2.Server → Response → Unity

🔹 Request & Response
Request: Sent by Unity (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
Response: Sent by server (JSON, status code)
