I learned how to design and implement a Virtual Factory Walkthrough using VS Code, without relying on game engines such as Unity. 
The implementation was done using web-based 3D technologies, which helped me understand how interactive 3D environments can be developed directly in the browser.
I learned the fundamentals of Three.js, including setting up a 3D scene, camera, renderer, lighting, and floor geometry.
I also learned how to import and render 3D models (GLB format) created in Blender using GLTFLoader, enabling the visualization of factory environments.
An important learning outcome was understanding ES Module imports in browsers. 
I learned why errors like “Failed to resolve module specifier ‘three’” occur and how to resolve them by using CDN-based imports and ensuring that each JavaScript file independently imports the required libraries.
I also implemented camera movement using a gaming joystick (8BitDo controller) through the Gamepad API.
This included smooth forward, backward, and rotational movement, dead-zone handling, and camera direction–based navigation, which enabled a realistic factory walkthrough experience.
In addition, I explored AI-based tools for 3D model creation and conversion, which can be used to generate or transform 3D assets into formats such as GLB/GLTF. 
This helped me understand how AI tools can reduce manual modeling effort and speed up asset preparation for 3D applications.
I also learned how to handle basic animations for 3D models using VS Code, including loading animation clips from GLB files and playing them programmatically within the Three.js environment.
This gave me insight into how animations can be controlled without using a game engine.
Furthermore, I gained practical experience in debugging web-based 3D applications, including fixing 404 resource loading issues (such as favicon errors) and properly running projects using a local development server.
Overall, this learning session enhanced my understanding of web-based 3D visualization, VR walkthrough development, joystick-based interaction, AI-assisted 3D asset creation, and animation handling, which are highly relevant for smart factory, digital twin, and industrial visualization applications.
