I focused on understanding the integration of backend systems with real-time data communication for smart factory and visualization applications.
I learned how to structure and test a Node.js and Python–based backend to handle machine data efficiently.
I explored MQTT and RabbitMQ concepts for real-time message communication, including how messages are published, subscribed, and processed between multiple systems.
I learned how to configure brokers, handle connection issues, and troubleshoot common errors related to ports, WebSocket connections, and service availability.
I also worked on frontend–backend integration, where I learned how to send and receive live data using WebSockets and display real-time machine information in a web interface.
This helped me understand how live industrial data can be visualized effectively in dashboards and 3D environments.
Additionally, I practiced debugging and project management using Git, including checking commit history, resolving missing files, restoring project structure, and understanding folder status indicators in GitHub. 
This improved my confidence in version control and collaborative development workflows.
By the end of the session, I gained a clearer understanding of how real-time data pipelines, message brokers, backend services, and frontend visualization work together in a smart factory or digital twin system.
