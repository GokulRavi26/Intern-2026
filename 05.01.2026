Unity XR & Animation Implementation
Overview

Yesterday’s work focused on understanding and implementing XR setup, joystick-based movement, and animation control in Unity. The goal was to configure the Unity environment correctly, test input devices, and play animations from existing FBX models.

1️⃣ XR Setup and Controller Integration

Explored XR Interaction Toolkit and XR Origin (XR Rig) structure.

Understood the difference between Hierarchy (GameObjects) and Inspector (Components).

Learned that locomotion components like Continuous Move Provider (Action-based) and Continuous Turn Provider (Action-based) must be added as components to XR Origin, not as child objects.

Verified joystick integration using XR Device Simulator and system gamepad detection.

2️⃣ Joystick Movement & Camera Flow

Studied how left joystick controls forward/backward and strafing movement.

Studied how right joystick controls camera rotation (turning).

Identified that correct Input Action configuration is required for joystick movement.

Learned that joystick input can be handled either through:

XR Interaction Toolkit (recommended for VR/XR), or

Custom scripts (manual control).

Understood that missing input bindings or incorrect rig setup causes camera movement issues.

3️⃣ Animation Handling in Unity

Learned how to import FBX models with pre-existing animations.

Understood how to:

Enable Import Animations

Set correct Rig type (Generic/Humanoid)

Created an Animator Controller and assigned it to the model.

Learned how to extract and drag animation clips (e.g., Take 001) from inside the FBX into the Animator window.

Set the animation as the default state so it plays automatically when the scene starts.

4️⃣ Common Issues & Fixes Learned

Camera not moving → incorrect XR Origin or locomotion setup.

Animation not playing → Animator Controller not assigned or default state not set.

Falling through ground → missing collider on the plane.

Sideways camera view → incorrect XR Origin or camera rotation values.

Conclusion

Through this session, practical knowledge was gained in XR rig configuration, joystick-based locomotion, and animation playback in Unity. This learning improves understanding of real-time interaction, camera control, and asset animation workflows, which are essential for VR, AR, and simulation-based applications.
