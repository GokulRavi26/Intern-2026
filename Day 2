Topic: Smart Factory 3D Visualization using React Three Fiber

🔹 What I Learned Today

  Today, I worked on building a 3D Smart Factory layout using React Three Fiber and Three.js concepts. 
  I learned how to render and control 3D models inside a web application and how to structure a factory-like scene.

🔹 Key Learnings

  Understood how React Three Fiber works as a React renderer for Three.js.
  Learned to load GLB 3D models using useGLTF from @react-three/drei.
  Implemented a 3D floor (plane) and adjusted its position, rotation, and scale.
  Learned how to duplicate 3D models and arrange them in rows and columns using loops.
  Gained hands-on experience with camera positioning, OrbitControls, zoom, pan, and rotation.
  Learned how to attach UI panels above 3D models using the Html component.
  Understood common issues like model scaling, camera clipping, and disappearing objects and how to fix them.
  Learned how to manage scene lighting using ambient and directional lights.
  Improved debugging skills related to blank screen issues in 3D scenes.

🔹 Outcome

  By the end of the day, I was able to:
    Display a 3D machine model on a factory floor
    Add interactive camera controls for 360° viewing
    Show a floating information panel above the machine displaying live data (Status, Count, OEE)

🔹 Tools & Technologies Used

    React.js
    Vite
    React Three Fiber
    Three.js
    @react-three/drei
    GLB 3D Models

🔹 Next Steps
    
    Arrange multiple machines in a full factory layout
    Add different machine models with individual data
    Improve visual realism with better lighting and materials
    Integrate real-time data into machine panels
