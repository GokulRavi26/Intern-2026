Docker is a tool used to run applications in an isolated environment called containers. It helps applications run the same way on any system.

Purpose of Docker:
  *Make application deployment easy
  *Avoid software compatibility issues
  *Run applications consistently on different computers
  *Reduce system resource usage
Docker Image: A Docker image is a template used to create containers. For Example ,eclipse-mosquitto is an image that contains the MQTT broker software.
Docker Container: A Docker container is a running version of an image.
Docker Compose: Docker Compose helps manage multiple containers using one file.
Docker Volume: A Docker volume is used to store data safely.
/mosquitto/config: This folder contains configuration files.It defines how the MQTT broker should behave.
/mosquitto/data: This folder stores runtime data of the broker.Contains persisted MQTT messages and session data.
/mosquitto/log: This folder stores log files generated by Mosquitto.Records connection, publish, and error messages.


MQTTX -->Testing tool
MQTTX

MQTTX is a desktop client tool used to test MQTT connections. It helps in publishing and subscribing to MQTT topics easily without writing code.
MQTTX is mainly used to verify whether the MQTT broker and message flow are working correctly.

MQTTX Testing Steps
Step 1: Open MQTTX
Launch the MQTTX application on the system.

Step 2: Create a New Connection
Click New Connection
Enter the following details:
Host: localhost
Port: 1883
Protocol: MQTT
Username/Password: Not required (anonymous access enabled)
Click Connect
✅ Connection status shows Connected

Step 3: Subscribe to a Topic
Go to the Subscribe section
Enter the topic name:
test/topic
Set QoS to 0
Click Subscribe

Step 4: Publish Messages
Go to the Publish section
Enter:
Topic: test/topic
Payload: Hello MQTT
Click Send

Step 5: Verify Message Reception
The subscribed message appears instantly in MQTTX
Confirms that the broker is working correctly

Step 6: Test Python Publisher
Run the Python MQTT script
Observe live messages appearing in MQTTX
Confirms end-to-end message flow
Step 7: Outcome:
Successfully verified MQTT broker functionality
Confirmed correct topic subscription and publishing
Validated real-time data transfer
